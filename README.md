# Numerical Analysis


This repository contains various toy problems which can be used to solve numerical problems in various fields like physics, engineering, finance and data analysis.

Topics covered as of now :
- Root finding using (i) Newton Raphson, (ii) Secant Method and (iii) Bisection Method.
- Numerical solution of ordinary differential equation (ODE) using (i) Eular's method and (ii) Runge Kutta (RK4) method. We have covered first order and second order differential equation.
